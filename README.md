A spam email detection model using machine learning is designed to classify incoming emails as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham). The model typically undergoes the following steps:

Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of labeled emails, where each email is tagged as spam or not spam. Public datasets like the Enron email dataset are often used.

Preprocessing: Clean the email text by removing irrelevant characters, HTML tags, and stop words. Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization may also be applied to standardize the text.

Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features. Common techniques include:

Bag of Words (BoW): Represents text as a frequency count of words.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Measures the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
Word Embeddings: Uses models like Word2Vec or GloVe to capture semantic meaning.
Model Training: Train a machine learning algorithm on the extracted features. Popular algorithms include:

Naive Bayes: Particularly effective for text classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds the optimal hyperplane for classification.
Logistic Regression: Suitable for binary classification tasks.
Random Forest or Gradient Boosting: Ensemble methods that improve predictive performance.
Deep Learning Models: Such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for more complex patterns.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation dataset.
